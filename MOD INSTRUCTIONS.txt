hey there thanks for installing my humble little mod! here are the instructions on how to properly use it:
1 install scarab or any other hollow knight modding tool if ya want 
2 make sure you install custom knight in the scarab app
3 add blush knight into the custom knight folder
4 go into the hollow knight mod settings (ingame)
5 go over to the "mods" section of the settings and select custom knight
6 click the arrows until you find blush knight 
(WARNING if the skin doesn't load properly then try the fix/reload option hope that helped and enjoy!)
